 # Code Quality
 
#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
 -[code](https://github.com/hilarylewis92/jetFuel/blob/master/server.js#L49-L54)
 
 * We implemented a redirect function for the shorten url to redirect to the long url instead of just putting the long url link as the href in the short url a tag. We are proud of this code because it took more time to implement, it is clean, and it is the right way to create a shorten url application.
 
#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about

 * Considering our time crunch for this project, we decided to allow the application to reload on submitting a new folder and url instead of preventing the defualt. We did this so the componentDidMount function would fire again in order to fetch the data from the api to render it to the page. If we did it the right way, we would have preventing the default and make another function to fetch the data on sumbit. This would have added more time which we did not have to meet our deadline.
